## Welcome to Captone Project

This project aims to utilize Machine Learing for portfolio allocation.

### Setup Instruction

1. Install Python 3.11
2. Create virtual environment: python3 -m venv env
3. Activate virtual environment: env\bin\activate (Linux/Mac) or env\Scripts\activate
4. Install python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

### To Run Expertiment

Run research.ipynb in Jupyter mode on VS Code

Alternatively, you can run as command line "python src/research.py" which should generate similar results as the research.ipynb
However, you need to install project code: pip install -e .


### Unittest

Unittest is added to ensure the generation of optimal allocation as Y for training target, and the calculation of Portfolio Value are accurate
